<h1>  Whenever we want to write a program, we should first think about writing comments. </h1>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red;">What are comments?</h2>

  <p style="font-size:120%;"> Comments are description about the features of a program.<br> 
  This means whatever we write in a program should be described using comments.
  </p>
  

<h2 style="color:red;">How many types of comments are available in java?</h2>

  <p style="font-size:120%;"> There are three types of comments available in Java:</p>
  
	<ol style="font-size:100%" type="1">
		<li><strong>Single line commnets:</strong>
		<p>These comments starts with "//" (double forward slashes). These comments should be written in single line<br><br>Eg:
		<code style="color:green">//comments goes here</code></p>
		</li>
		
		<li><strong>Multi line commnets:</strong>
		<p>These comments starts with "/*" (one forward slash followed by an one astrik) and ends with "*/" (one astrik followed by an forward slash). These comments are used to write in multiple lines<br><br>Eg:
		<code style="color:green"><br>/* This is a multi line comment. This is line one
		<br> This is line two of the comment.
		<br> This is line three of the comment.
		<br>*/
		</code></p>
		</li>
		
		<li><strong>Java documentation commnets:</strong>
		<p>These comments starts with "/**" and ends with "*/". These comments are used to provide description for every feature in a  Java Program<br><br>Eg:<br>
		<code style="color:blue">
		<br>/** description about a class */
		
		<br>class DemoProgram{
		<p>
		<br>
		/** description about a method*/<br>
		public static void main(String args[]){
		}
		</p>
		}
		</code></p>
