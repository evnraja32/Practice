/**
Whenever we want to write a program, we should first think about writing comments.


What are comments?

Comments are description about the features of a program.
This means whatever we write in a program should be described using comments.

There are three types of comments available in Java:

1. Single line commnets:
These comments starts with "//" (double forward slashes). These comments should be written in single line

2. Multi line commnets:
These comments starts with "/*" and ends with "* /". 
These comments are used to write in multiple lines.

3. Java documentation commnets:
These comments starts with "/**" and ends with "* /". "
"These comments are used to provide description for every feature in a Java Program.
